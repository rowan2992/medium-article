      <h2>Origins of the book</h2>
      <p>After eight other publishers had rejected Philosopher's Stone, Bloomsbury offered Rowling a Â£2,500 advance for its
      publication. Despite Rowling's statement that she did not have any particular age group in mind when beginning
      to write the Harry Potter books, the publishers initially targeted children aged nine to eleven.</p>
      <h2>Translations</h2>
      <p>The series has been translated into 80 languages, placing Rowling among the most translated authors in history.
      The books have seen translations to diverse languages such as Korean, Armenian, Ukrainian, Arabic, Urdu, Hindi, Bengali,
      Bulgarian, Welsh, Afrikaans, Albanian, Latvian, Vietnamese and Hawaiian.</p>

      <h2>Cover Art</h2>
      <p>For cover art, Bloomsbury chose painted art in a classic style of design, with the first cover a watercolour and pencil
      drawing by illustrator Thomas Taylor showing Harry boarding the Hogwarts Express, and a title in the font Cochin Bold.</p>
